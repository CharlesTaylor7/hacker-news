# hacker-news

An alternative frontend to read hackernews. Uses the [public API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).


## Goals
- PWA
- Dark mode / light mode toggle
- Mobile first, but still looks good on desktop.


## TODO
- Fix eyesores:
    - Link text color
    - Font size
    - expand / collapse button needs to be more button like
    - buttons need to be inline with text
    
## Ideas
- Autoload new comments
- Watch / dismiss threads.
- mark comments as read / unread
